### Native Android App

### Description

During my time at Action Plus Ideas a promotional products company in 2016 I worked on a concept where customers could instantaneously upload their logo and have it placed on a product for mockups and I was developing a method for customers to see the products in VR with 3D models. Similar to what you see now with shops like Amazon and Best Buy where you can virtually view products in your home. This was mostly an expirement and just for fun but made some decent headway. The logo upload and modkup generation worked and customers were able to view some products in VR that I had built 3D models for.
